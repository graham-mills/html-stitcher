# html-stitcher

`html-stitcher` is a simple CLI tool for combining HTML files. It allows for large HTML files to be decomposed into smaller, and optionally re-usable, components (referred to here as "partials").

Let's start with a simple example to show the basic principle:

We start with an input file for processing, named `index.html`:
```html
<!-- index.html -->
<html>
<body>
    <welcome/>
</body>
</html>
```
The input file includes the `<welcome/>` element. This tells `html-stitcher` to replace the element with the contents of `welcome.html`:

```html
<!-- welcome.html -->
<p>
    Hello world!
</p>
```
The output generated by `html-stitcher` is simply the combination of both files:

```html
<!-- output.html -->
<html>
<body>
    <p>
        Hello world!
    </p>
</body>
</html>
```
